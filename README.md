# Kubernetes-Complete

is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications. It is not a single software, but a mixture of tools.

## We (Maybe) have a problem

- Manual deployment of containers is hard to maintain, error-prone andf annoying(even beyond the security and config concerns). 
- Containers may crash/ go down and need to be replaced, and manually restart the container thereafter. We cant just manage our day just to check if the container is running/shut down.
- We might need more container instances upon traffic spikes.
- Also we need to ensure, incoming traffic should be distributed equally and a single container is not performing all the tasks.

  So these are definitely big problems when deploying containers.

## Why kubernetes?

Using a specific cloud service locks us into that service. You need to learn about the specifics services and config options of another provider if you want to switch.

Just knowing Docker isnt enough!!**

and thats where **kubernetes** can helpus.
